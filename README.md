This repository started as a fork of `shai-hulud-detect`, originally created around the September 2025 campaign, and evolved into a broader detector for real npm supply-chain incidents.

The goal is simple: give you a fast, local way to answer "did this repo pull something known-bad?" without waiting for a SaaS integration, a vendor dashboard, or a postmortem thread to catch up.

It currently covers major campaigns from September 2025 through August 2026, including the chalk/debug crypto theft incident, the September 2025 self-propagating npm campaign, the fake Bun runtime attacks, SANDWORM_MODE, the March 2026 axios maintainer account takeover, Mini Shai-Hulud/TanStack/AntV waves, Miasma-related waves, and the August 2026 keyv/cacheable compromise. Under the hood it cross-checks 5,100+ confirmed malicious package versions, suspicious workflow patterns, installer hooks, hashes, persistence hooks, and related IoCs across npm plus upstream-supported PyPI, Composer, Crates, Go, Hex, and RubyGems manifests.

## Why this exists

- Because lockfiles, CI logs, and `node_modules` tell the truth faster than speculation.
- Because supply-chain incidents keep changing names, but the responder workflow is always the same: identify exposure, isolate the blast radius, and move.
- Because I wanted a tool that is transparent, hackable, and easy to extend the same day a new campaign drops.

## Who this is for

- Engineers doing incident triage on JavaScript/TypeScript repos
- AppSec and DevSecOps teams auditing fleets of npm projects
- Anyone who wants a local detector they can read, patch, and run in CI

## Overview

Covers multiple npm supply chain attacks from September 2025 through August 2026:

### **Chalk/Debug Crypto Theft Attack** (September 8, 2025)
- **Scope**: 18+ packages with 2+ billion weekly downloads
- **Attack**: Cryptocurrency wallet address replacement in browsers
- **Duration**: ~2 hours before detection
- **Packages**: chalk, debug, ansi-styles, color-*, supports-*, and others
- **Method**: XMLHttpRequest hijacking to steal crypto transactions

### **September 2025 Self-Propagating npm Campaign** (September 14-16, 2025)
- **Scope**: 517+ packages across multiple namespaces
- **Attack**: Credential harvesting and self-propagation
- **Method**: Uses Trufflehog to scan for secrets, publishes stolen data to GitHub
- **Propagation**: Self-replicates using stolen npm tokens
- **Packages**: @ctrl/*, @crowdstrike/*, @operato/*, and many others

### **November 2025 Fake Bun Runtime Attack** (November 24, 2025)
- **Scope**: 300+ packages with millions of weekly downloads
- **Attack**: Fake Bun runtime installation with credential harvesting
- **Method**: Uses fake `setup_bun.js` preinstall hook to download and execute TruffleHog
- **Exfiltration**: Creates GitHub Actions runners named "SHA1HULUD" and repositories with attacker-controlled descriptions used for credential staging
- **Packages**: @zapier/*, @posthog/*, @asyncapi/*, @postman/*, @ensdomains/*, and many others
- **Files**: `setup_bun.js`, `bun_environment.js` (10MB+ obfuscated payload), `actionsSecrets.json` (double Base64 encoded)
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/formatter_*.yml` files using SHA1HULUD runners

### **December 2025 Golden Path Variant** (December 28, 2025)
- **Scope**: Continuation of the November 2025 fake Bun attack with renamed files
- **Attack**: Same fake Bun runtime technique with obfuscated file names
- **Method**: Uses `bun_installer.js` and `environment_source.js` (renamed from `setup_bun.js` and `bun_environment.js`)
- **Exfiltration**: Obfuscated JSON files for staging stolen credentials: `3nvir0nm3nt.json`, `cl0vd.json`, `c9nt3nts.json`, `pigS3cr3ts.json`
- **Packages**: @vietmoney/react-big-calendar (versions 0.26.0-0.26.2)
- **Repo Description**: "Goldox-T3chs: Only Happy Girl"

### **SANDWORM_MODE AI Toolchain Poisoning** (February 17, 2026)
- **Scope**: 19 confirmed malicious npm packages + workflow propagation IoCs
- **Attack**: Typosquatted AI toolchain packages and poisoned CI workflow distribution
- **Method**: Malicious GitHub Action `ci-quality/code-quality-check@v1` injects `.github/workflows/quality.yml`
- **Threat actor aliases**: `official334`, `javaorg`
- **Packages**: `claud-code`, `cloude-code`, `cloude`, `opencraw`, `veim`, `yarsg`, and others
- **Source**: [Socket.dev analysis](https://socket.dev/blog/sandworm-mode-npm-worm-ai-toolchain-poisoning)

### **Axios Maintainer Account Takeover** (March 31, 2026)
- **Scope**: Official `axios` npm package compromised for roughly 3 hours via hijacked maintainer access
- **Attack**: Malicious dependency injection delivering a cross-platform RAT during install
- **Method**: `axios@1.14.1` and `axios@0.30.4` shipped with malicious `plain-crypto-js@4.2.1`
- **Related packages**: `@qqbrowser/openclaw-qbot@0.0.130`, `@shadanai/openclaw@2026.3.31-1`, `@shadanai/openclaw@2026.3.31-2`
- **Primary network IOC**: `sfrclak[.]com:8000` / `142.11.206.73`
- **Source**: [The Hacker News coverage](https://thehackernews.com/2026/03/axios-supply-chain-attack-pushes-cross.html)

### **Mini Shai-Hulud SAP/TanStack Waves** (April 29 - May 12, 2026)
- **Scope**: SAP CAP tooling, Intercom, TanStack router packages, Mistral AI, UiPath, Squawk, TallyUI, and related clusters
- **Attack**: Install-time Bun payloads, TanStack Git dependency abuse, credential theft, and AI-tool persistence
- **Method**: `setup.mjs` / `execution.js` in the SAP wave, then `router_init.js`, `router_runtime.js`, `tanstack_runner.js`, and `@tanstack/setup` in the TanStack wave
- **Persistence**: `.claude/settings.json` `SessionStart` hooks and `.vscode/tasks.json` task injection
- **Primary network IOCs**: `filev2.getsession.org/file/`, AWS/ECS metadata endpoints, `registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/tokens`, `vault.svc.cluster.local:8200`
- **Sources**: [Socket Mini Shai-Hulud tracker](https://socket.dev/supply-chain-attacks/mini-shai-hulud), [Aikido follow-up](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/mini-shai-hulud-is-back-tanstack-compromised)

### **Keyv/Cacheable Compromise and Worm Propagation** (August 4, 2026)
- **Scope**: `keyv`, `cacheable`, `flat-cache`, `file-entry-cache`, `cache-manager`, `@cacheable/*`, and worm-propagated packages across affected publishers
- **Attack**: Malicious `preinstall` hook downloads a Bun runtime, executes `Math_Symbol.js`, steals cloud/CI/registry credentials, and republishes poisoned packages
- **Method**: `setup.mjs`, `Math_Symbol.js` / `math_init.js`, npm OIDC token exchange, GitHub dead-drop repositories, and IDE/agent hooks
- **Persistence**: `.claude/settings.json` `SessionStart`, `.vscode/tasks.json` `folderOpen`, and `gh-token-monitor` dead-man switch artifacts
- **Primary IOCs**: `github.com/oven-sh/bun/releases/download/bun-v1.3.13/`, `registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/oidc/token/exchange/package/`, AWS/ECS metadata endpoints, and known SHA-256 payload hashes
- **Sources**: [Socket analysis](https://socket.dev/blog/popular-npm-packages-in-the-keyv-and-cacheable-namespaces-compromised-in-active-supply-chain), [Socket campaign tracker](https://socket.dev/supply-chain-attacks/keyv-and-cacheable-compromise), [SafeDep package appendix](https://safedep.io/keyv-npm-supply-chain-compromise/)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/otaviomarcal/npm-supply-chain-detector
cd npm-supply-chain-detector

# Make the script executable
chmod +x nsc-scan.sh

# Open the guided launcher
./nsc-scan.sh

# Scan your project for known supply-chain indicators
./nsc-scan.sh /path/to/your/project

# For comprehensive security scanning
./nsc-scan.sh --paranoid /path/to/your/project

# Save findings to a log file for review or CI/CD artifacts
./nsc-scan.sh --save-log report.log /path/to/your/project

# Write structured JSON output
./nsc-scan.sh --json findings.json /path/to/your/project

# Discover and scan many projects under a root
./nsc-scan.sh --bulk /path/to/workspace

# Check exit code for CI/CD integration
./nsc-scan.sh /path/to/your/project
echo "Exit code: $?"  # 0=clean, 1=high-risk, 2=medium-risk
```

`nsc-scan.sh` is the short day-to-day entrypoint. It now provides a guided launcher when you run it with no arguments in a terminal. `npm-supply-chain-detector.sh` and the legacy upstream script name remain available for compatibility.

### Global npm install

```bash
npm install -g @otaviomarcal/npm-supply-chain-detector

# Then run from anywhere
nsc-scan /path/to/your/project
```

On Windows, the npm package uses a small Node launcher that looks for a compatible Bash runtime. WSL or Git Bash is recommended. You can override the detected runtime with `NSC_BASH_PATH`.

## Philosophy

- High signal over novelty: exact compromised versions and concrete IoCs beat vague "AI risk scoring"
- Local-first: the scanner should work on a laptop, in CI, and inside a messy incident response shell session
- Easy to update: new package versions and test fixtures should be cheap to add when a campaign breaks
- Better operator UX: fast presets and guided scans matter when someone is triaging under pressure

## Guided Launcher

Run `./nsc-scan.sh` with no arguments to open an interactive launcher instead of memorizing flags.

Example menu:

```text
npm Supply Chain Detector

  1) Quick triage
  2) Deep audit
  3) Semver exposure
  4) Incident response bundle
  5) Custom guided scan
  q) Quit
```

Available scan profiles:

- **Quick triage**: runs the default core scan. Best for a fast answer to "is this repo obviously exposed right now?"
- **Deep audit**: adds `--paranoid` checks for typosquatting and suspicious network/exfiltration patterns. Useful when you want broader coverage and can tolerate more noise.
- **Semver exposure**: adds `--check-semver-ranges` to find packages that could resolve to compromised versions during install/update, even if the exact bad version is not locked today.
- **Incident response bundle**: combines `--paranoid` and `--check-semver-ranges`, then asks where to save a log file. This is the preset for real incident handling and evidence capture.
- **Custom guided scan**: lets you choose each option interactively, including whether to save a log and which grep engine to use.

Typical flow:

1. Run `./nsc-scan.sh`
2. Pick the scan profile that matches the situation
3. Enter the target directory
4. Choose the grep engine (`auto`, `git grep`, `ripgrep`, or `grep`)
5. Let the launcher execute the underlying detector with the right flags

If you already know the flags you want, `nsc-scan.sh` still passes them straight through to the detector engine.

**CI/CD Integration**: The script returns appropriate exit codes (0=clean, 1=high-risk, 2=medium-risk) for seamless integration into automated security pipelines.

## What it Detects

### High Risk Indicators
- **Malicious workflow files**: `shai-hulud-workflow.yml` files in `.github/workflows/` (September 2025), `formatter_*.yml` files using SHA1HULUD runners (November 2025), and SANDWORM_MODE workflow IoCs including `ci-quality/code-quality-check@v1` and poisoned `quality.yml` workflow references (February 2026)
- **Known malicious file hashes**: Files matching known SHA-256 hashes from tracked campaign variants, including September-December 2025 payloads, Mini Shai-Hulud files, and August 2026 Keyv/Cacheable loader and payload hashes
- **Mini Shai-Hulud payload and persistence IoCs**: `router_init.js`, `router_runtime.js`, `tanstack_runner.js`, `@tanstack/setup`, `github:tanstack/router#79ac49eedf774dd4b0cfa308722bc463cfe5885c`, `setup.mjs`, `.claude/settings.json` `SessionStart`, and `.vscode/tasks.json` persistence hooks
- **Keyv/Cacheable August 2026 IoCs**: `setup.mjs`, `Math_Symbol.js`, `math_init.js`, `bun-v1.3.13`, npm OIDC token exchange, `.claude` / `.vscode` autostart hooks, `gh-token-monitor` persistence, and known SHA-256 payload hashes
- **November 2025 Bun attack files**: `setup_bun.js`/`bun_installer.js` (fake Bun runtime installer) and `bun_environment.js`/`environment_source.js` (10MB+ obfuscated credential harvesting payload)
- **Obfuscated exfiltration files**: `3nvir0nm3nt.json`, `cl0vd.json`, `c9nt3nts.json`, `pigS3cr3ts.json` (December 2025 variant - stolen credentials staged for exfiltration)
- **Compromised package versions**: Specific versions of 5,100+ packages from multiple attacks (September 2025 through August 2026), including `axios@1.14.1`, `axios@0.30.4`, `plain-crypto-js@4.2.1`, `@tanstack/react-router@1.169.8`, `@mistralai/mistralai@2.2.4`, and `keyv@6.0.0`
- **Suspicious postinstall hooks**: Package.json files with postinstall scripts containing curl, wget, eval commands, or fake Bun installation (`"preinstall": "node setup_bun.js"`)
- **Trufflehog activity**: Files containing trufflehog references, credential scanning patterns, or November 2025 enhanced patterns (automated TruffleHog download and execution)
- **Malicious exfiltration repositories**: Git repositories named "Shai-Hulud" or with "Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming" or "Goldox-T3chs: Only Happy Girl" descriptions
- **Secrets exfiltration files**: `actionsSecrets.json` files with double Base64 encoded credentials (November 2025)
- **SHA1HULUD GitHub Actions runners**: GitHub Actions workflows using malicious runners for credential theft
- **SANDWORM_MODE workflow IoCs**: Workflow files containing `ci-quality/code-quality-check@v1`, actor aliases (`official334`, `javaorg`), or related propagation module references
- **Additional upstream campaign IoCs**: Miasma, Megalodon, Web3 MCP typosquats, Polymarket, sl4x0, art-template, durabletask, TrapDoor, Laravel-Lang, node-ipc, Bitwarden CLI, Nx Console, IronWorm, and related waves

### Medium Risk Indicators
- **Suspicious content patterns**: References to `webhook.site` and the malicious endpoint `bb8ca5f6-4175-45d2-b042-fc9ebb8170b7`
- **Suspicious git branches**: Branches matching known exfiltration naming patterns such as `shai-hulud`
- **Semver pattern matching**: Packages that could become compromised during `npm update` due to caret (^) or tilde (~) version patterns

### Low Risk Indicators
- **Namespace warnings**: Packages from namespaces known to be affected (@ctrl, @crowdstrike, @art-ws, @ngx, @nativescript-community) but at safe versions

### Package Detection Method

The script loads a list of the compromised packages from an external file (`compromised-packages.txt`) which contains:
- **5,100+ confirmed compromised package versions** with exact version numbers (September 2025 through August 2026 campaigns)
- **18+ affected namespaces** for broader detection of packages from compromised maintainer accounts

### Maintaining and Updating the Package List

**Important**: New malicious versions keep surfacing after the first headline. The compromised packages list is stored in `compromised-packages.txt` for easy maintenance:

- **Format**: `package_name:version` for npm-compatible bare entries, or `ecosystem:package_name:version` for explicit ecosystem entries such as `pypi:`, `composer:`, `crates:`, `go:`, `hex:`, and `gem:`
- **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` are ignored
- **Updates**: The file can be updated as new compromised packages are discovered
- **Fallback**: If the file is missing, the script uses a core embedded list

### How to Add Newly Discovered Packages

1. Check the security advisories above for new compromised packages
2. Add them to `compromised-packages.txt` in the format `package_name:version`
3. Test the script to ensure detection works
4. Consider contributing updates back to this repository

**Coverage Note**: Multiple campaigns from September 2025 through August 2026 affected 5,100+ package versions total in this detector's current corpus. Coverage now includes the September 2025 self-propagating campaign, Chalk/Debug crypto theft, the November 2025 fake Bun runtime attack, the Golden Path variant, the February 2026 SANDWORM_MODE campaign, the March 2026 axios compromise, the April-May 2026 Mini Shai-Hulud SAP/TanStack waves, and the August 2026 keyv/cacheable compromise.

### Core vs Paranoid Mode

**Core Mode (Default)**
- Focuses on high-confidence supply-chain incident indicators
- Recommended for most users who want fast triage with minimal noise
- Clean, focused output with minimal false positives

**Paranoid Mode (`--paranoid`)**
- Includes all core supply-chain detection plus additional security checks
- Adds typosquatting detection and network exfiltration pattern analysis
- **Important**: Paranoid features are general security tools, not specific to a single campaign
- May produce more false positives from legitimate code
- Useful for comprehensive security auditing

**Semver Range Checking (`--check-semver-ranges`)**
- Checks if package.json semver ranges (^, ~) could resolve to compromised versions
- Reports LOW risk in both cases (informational warning about latent risk)
- Useful for identifying latent risk in private npm caches that may still have malicious versions

## Requirements

- macOS or Unix-like system
- **Bash 5.0 or newer** (required for associative arrays and performance features)
  - macOS: `brew install bash` then run with `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash ./nsc-scan.sh`
  - Linux: Most modern distributions include Bash 5.x by default
  - Check your version: `bash --version`
- Standard Unix tools: `find`, `grep`, `shasum`
- Optional: `jq` for `--json` output

### Grep Tool Selection

The script automatically selects the fastest available grep tool in this priority order:
1. **git grep** (default) - Uses a DFA-based regex engine with no backtracking, fastest for our patterns (~40% faster than ripgrep)
2. **ripgrep** (fallback) - Also DFA-based, excellent performance
3. **grep** (last resort) - May experience catastrophic backtracking on complex patterns

You can override the auto-selection with flags:
- `--use-git-grep` - Force git grep
- `--use-ripgrep` - Force ripgrep
- `--use-grep` - Force standard grep

**Why git grep is default**: Our testing shows git grep is ~40% faster than ripgrep on large codebases. Both use DFA-based regex engines that avoid the catastrophic backtracking that causes standard grep to hang on complex patterns.

## Output Interpretation

### Clean System
```
✅ No indicators of known npm supply-chain compromise detected.
Your system appears clean for the campaigns covered by this detector.
```

### Compromised System
The script will show:
- **🚨 HIGH RISK**: Definitive indicators of compromise
- **⚠️ MEDIUM RISK**: Suspicious patterns requiring manual review
- **Summary**: Count of issues found

### What to Do if Issues are Found

#### High Risk Issues
- **Immediate action required**
- Update or remove compromised packages
- Review and remove malicious workflow files
- Scan for credential theft
- Consider full system audit

#### Medium Risk Issues
- **Manual investigation needed**
- Review flagged files for legitimacy
- Check if webhook.site usage is intentional
- Verify git branch purposes

## Exit Codes for CI/CD Integration

The script returns specific exit codes to enable proper CI/CD pipeline integration:

- **Exit Code 0**: Clean system - no significant security findings
- **Exit Code 1**: High-risk findings detected - immediate action required
- **Exit Code 2**: Medium-risk findings detected - manual investigation needed

### CI/CD Pipeline Examples

#### GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Security Scan with npm Supply Chain Detector
  run: |
    chmod +x ./nsc-scan.sh
    ./nsc-scan.sh .
  # Pipeline will automatically fail on exit codes 1 or 2
```

#### GitLab CI
```yaml
security_scan:
  script:
    - chmod +x ./nsc-scan.sh
    - ./nsc-scan.sh .
  # Job fails automatically on non-zero exit codes
```

#### Jenkins
```groovy
stage('Security Scan') {
  steps {
    sh '''
      chmod +x ./nsc-scan.sh
      ./nsc-scan.sh .
    '''
  }
  // Build fails automatically on non-zero exit codes
}
```

#### Custom Handling by Exit Code
```bash
#!/bin/bash
./nsc-scan.sh .
exit_code=$?

case $exit_code in
    0) echo "✅ Security scan passed - no issues found" ;;
    1) echo "🚨 CRITICAL: High-risk security issues found - blocking deployment"
       exit 1 ;;
    2) echo "⚠️ WARNING: Medium-risk issues found - review required"
       # Could choose to continue with warnings
       ;;
esac
```

### Saving Findings to a Log File

Use `--save-log FILE` to save all detected file paths to a structured log file:

```bash
./nsc-scan.sh --save-log findings.log /path/to/project
```

The log file contains file paths grouped by severity level:

```
# HIGH
/path/to/malicious-workflow.yml
/path/to/compromised-package.json
# MEDIUM
/path/to/suspicious-content.js
# LOW
/path/to/namespace-warning.json
```

This format is designed for:
- **CI/CD artifacts**: Store scan results as build artifacts for review
- **Programmatic parsing**: Easy to parse with simple scripts
- **Full coverage**: Includes ALL findings without display truncation

### JSON Output

Use `--json FILE` when another tool needs structured findings:

```bash
./nsc-scan.sh --json findings.json /path/to/project
```

The JSON writer requires `jq`.

### Bulk Scanning

Use `--bulk` to discover multiple projects below one or more workspace roots and produce an aggregate report:

```bash
./nsc-scan.sh --bulk /path/to/workspace
```

## Testing

The repository includes a growing regression suite with targeted fixtures for real campaigns. Use the automated test runner to validate the detector behavior:

```bash
# Run the full test suite (recommended)
./run-tests.sh

# The test suite validates expected exit codes and risk levels for the maintained fixtures
# Exit codes: 0=clean, 1=high-risk, 2=medium-risk
```

You can also run individual test cases manually:

```bash
# Test on clean project (should show no issues)
./nsc-scan.sh test-cases/clean-project

# Test on infected project (should show multiple issues)
./nsc-scan.sh test-cases/infected-project

### Paranoid Mode Testing

The `--paranoid` flag enables additional security checks beyond the core incident signatures:

- **Typosquatting Detection**: Identifies packages with names similar to popular packages (e.g., "raect" instead of "react", "lodsh" instead of "lodash")
- **Network Exfiltration Patterns**: Detects suspicious domains (webhook.site, pastebin.com), hardcoded IP addresses, WebSocket connections to external endpoints
- **Enhanced Security Auditing**: Useful for comprehensive project security reviews

**Note**: Paranoid mode may produce more false positives from legitimate code patterns, so review findings carefully.

## How it Works

The script performs these checks:

1. **Package Database Loading**: Loads 5,100+ compromised packages from `compromised-packages.txt` into O(1) lookup maps
2. **Workflow Detection**: Searches for `shai-hulud-workflow.yml` files (September 2025), `formatter_*.yml` files with SHA1HULUD runners (November 2025), and SANDWORM_MODE workflow IoCs (February 2026)
3. **Hash Verification**: Calculates SHA-256 hashes against known malicious payload hashes, including the Mini Shai-Hulud `router_init.js` / `tanstack_runner.js` and Keyv/Cacheable `setup.mjs` / `Math_Symbol.js` indicators
4. **Package Analysis**: Parses `package.json` files for compromised versions and affected namespaces
5. **Semver Range Checking** (opt-in with `--check-semver-ranges`): Checks if version ranges could resolve to compromised versions
6. **Postinstall Hook Detection**: Identifies suspicious postinstall/preinstall scripts containing curl, wget, eval, or fake Bun patterns
7. **Content Scanning**: Searches for suspicious URLs, webhook endpoints, and malicious patterns
8. **Cryptocurrency Theft Detection**: Identifies wallet replacement patterns, XMLHttpRequest hijacking, and crypto theft functions
9. **Trufflehog Activity Detection**: Looks for credential scanning tools and secret harvesting patterns
10. **Git Analysis**: Checks for suspicious branch names tied to known exfiltration patterns
11. **Repository Detection**: Identifies known malicious repository descriptions and exfiltration repo patterns
12. **November 2025 Bun Attack Detection**: Identifies `setup_bun.js`/`bun_installer.js` and `bun_environment.js`/`environment_source.js` attack files
13. **Mini Shai-Hulud IOC Detection**: Identifies `setup.mjs`, `execution.js`, `router_init.js`, `router_runtime.js`, `tanstack_runner.js`, `@tanstack/setup`, `.claude/settings.json` `SessionStart`, and `.vscode/tasks.json` persistence hooks
14. **Keyv/Cacheable IOC Detection**: Identifies `setup.mjs`, `Math_Symbol.js`, `math_init.js`, Bun loader strings, npm OIDC token exchange, `.claude` / `.vscode` hooks, and `gh-token-monitor` persistence
15. **GitHub Actions Runner Detection**: Identifies malicious SHA1HULUD runners
16. **Discussion Workflow Detection**: Identifies workflows that trigger on discussion events (stealth persistence)
17. **Destructive Payload Detection**: Identifies destructive fallback patterns (`rm -rf`, `fs.rmSync`, etc.)
18. **Lockfile Integrity Checking**: Analyzes package-lock.json, yarn.lock, and pnpm-lock.yaml for compromised packages
19. **Typosquatting Detection** (paranoid mode): Identifies packages with names similar to popular packages
20. **Network Exfiltration Detection** (paranoid mode): Detects suspicious domains and hardcoded IPs
21. **Obfuscated Exfiltration Detection**: Identifies December 2025 staging files (`3nvir0nm3nt.json`, `cl0vd.json`, etc.)

## Limitations

- **Hash Detection**: Only detects files with exact matches to the currently encoded malicious hashes
- **Package Versions**: Detects specific compromised versions; new variants may not be detected until the package list is updated
- **False Positives**: Legitimate use of webhook.site, Trufflehog, or postinstall hooks may trigger alerts
- **Campaign Evolution**: New variants may emerge with different signatures
- **Semver Ranges**: The `--check-semver-ranges` flag is informational only; compromised versions are largely unpublished from npm

## Security Note

This script is for **detection only**. It does not:
- Automatically remove malicious code
- Fix compromised packages
- Prevent future attacks

Always verify findings manually and take appropriate remediation steps.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially when a new incident breaks and the ecosystem needs coverage before the tooling catches up.

### How to Contribute

#### Adding New Compromised Packages

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub, then clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/npm-supply-chain-detector.git
   cd npm-supply-chain-detector
   ```

2. **Update the package list**
   - Add new packages to `compromised-packages.txt` in the format `package_name:version`
   - Include a source/reference for where you found the compromised package

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   ./run-tests.sh
   # All 38 tests should pass
   ```
